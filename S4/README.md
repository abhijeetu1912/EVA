# STEP 1 - Build the basic skeleton 

Target:
Build the code skeleton and achieve a decent accuracy

Results:
Parameters: 185,930
Best Train Accuracy: 99.56
Best Test Accuracy: 99.13

Analysis:
Overfitting as performance on test data is lower.
Training is not stable as accuracy of 99.23 was reached in 8th epoch but afterwards accuracy keeps changing from low to high.
